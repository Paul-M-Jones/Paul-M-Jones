## Hello!

This is largely a placeholder and reflects both my current progress and future ambitions.  
It will be updated as I learn and grow.

### About Me

Hi! I'm teaching myself Python and AI in my spare time, with the long-term goal of transitioning into a coding or game development role. I currently work full-time, so Iâ€™m learning in short bursts â€” focusing on consistency and real-world understanding over speed. I am also using AI to help me write and understand more complex code.

My main interests are:
- AI and automation  
- Game mechanics â€” especially unusual, experimental, or tactical systems

---

### What Iâ€™m Working On
- Practising Python (as of March 2025) and exploring PyTorch (not yet truly started)  
- Learning to build small tools, scripts, and bots  
- Looking into ways to train AI to play games  
- Making a simple game in Unity

---

### Current Focus
- Deepening my understanding of Python fundamentals  
- Starting simple AI projects and experiments  
- Planning to build my first game-related AI project this year

---

### ðŸ“˜ How I Work

I upload:
- Practice scripts and function tests  
- Annotated notebooks for learning AI frameworks  
- Small, complete projects whenever possible  
- Reflections and notes in README files as I go

This profile is meant to show progress, not perfection.
